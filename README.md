## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales?datasetId=284 

This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.

 There appears to be some missing data past 2019.

Fields include:
* Rank - Ranking of overall sales
* Name - The games name
* Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)
* Year - Year of the game's release
* Genre - Genre of the game
* Publisher - Publisher of the game
* NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)
* EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)
* JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)
* Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
* Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.

## Pre-analysis
Looking at the fields above, here's a list of potential insights:
* Find top genres / genre distribution for each region
* Sales numbers by year per region
* Aggregate sales data for each platform. Maybe by region
* Most popular genre each year.
* Publishers with diverse releases (several genres) vs publishers with single genres: Is it more profitable to diversify or specialize?
* Which platforms supports the most number of games? Which platform supports the most variety of game types?
* Does a publisherâ€™s success correlate to how many games it releases?
* Plot publisher growth over the years
* OVERALL: Aggregates based on platform, genre, region
* FOR FUN: Maybe do something with the game names, maybe a wordcloud?


## Key Highlights
Sales numbers are in millions of dollars. Find the rest of the data in the VGS Aggregates files.
